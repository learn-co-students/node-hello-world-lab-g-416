# Node Hello World

## Objectives

1. Implement Hello World in Node
1. Run the script from the terminal


## Introduction

In this lab, you'll practice how to run Node scripts from command line. In addition, you'll develop your first Node applicationâ€”Hello World, the traditional first app in any language.

## Instructions

1. Create file `hello-world.js` and open it in your favorite editor
2. Implement an expression (function with `return`) which returns "Hello World". Be very meticulous about the function output. Don't worry about the specific name of the function. It can be whatever you want!
3. Export your expression (function with `return`) with `module.exports = <function name>` to allow other programs, modules and especially our wonderful Learn lab tests to verify your solution. In other words,  you need to export this expression/function so that our specs have access to this function to test the return value.
5. Install testing dependencies with `npm install`. You need to run `npm install` just once for each lab. It will download Mocha, Chai and other dependencies for the tests.
6. Run tests with `npm test`.

Tip: Don't overthink it.
